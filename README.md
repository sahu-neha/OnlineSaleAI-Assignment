## Task-1: Simulation of an Event that Follows Given Biasness

**Problem Statement:** Write a program that simulates an event with biased outcomes. The program accepts a map of possible outcomes and their probabilities. The outcomes are generated based on the provided probabilities.

**Example Usage:**
- Rolling a biased six-faced dice.
- Flipping a biased coin.

**Rules:**
- Probabilities can be provided as integers or percentages.
- Each occurrence of the event generates one outcome independently.
- Large numbers of event occurrences should follow the provided biasness.

## Task-2: Evaluate Multiple Mathematical Expressions Using a Web API

**Problem Statement:** Create a program that evaluates multiple mathematical expressions in bulk using a web API. The program should display the results for each expression.

**Example Usage:**
- Evaluate expressions like "2 * 4 * 4" or "sqrt(5^2 - 4^2)".
- Use a web API for evaluations.

**Rules:**
- No local evaluation of expressions; all evaluations are done using a web API.
- Handle the API's rate limits (e.g., 50 requests per second per client) and concurrency.

## Task-3: Debugging

**Problem Statement:** Debug a Bash or Python script that performs computations based on an integer input (n). The script has bugs that need to be identified and fixed.

**Example Usage:**
- The script calculates squares, factorials, or sums based on the input value.

**Rules:**
- Identify and fix bugs in the provided Bash or Python script.
- Minimize changes to the script (less than 5 characters).
